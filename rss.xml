            <description><![CDATA[<p>Knowledge is the common agreement of what is repeatable and transmittable.

Practice “whatever-ing” to invert this logic.
“Whatever-ing” entails dancing through the world while affirming “it certainly totally could also be that”.
Do this before definitely totally indefatigably saying “no way ever, no no, that cannot be, uh uh, can’t be”

Use knowledge as the material to do so.
(Mine, yours, everyones.)
Keep repeating and transmitting and repeating and transmitting as infinitum (and see what happens)</p>]]></description>
